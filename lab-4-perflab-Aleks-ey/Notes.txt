First change: 
In MakeFile
Line 9 originally looks like this CXXFLAGS= -g -O0 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -Wall
We can change -O0 to -O2/-O3 for faster omptimization
After testing both it seems -O3 had better results for me

Second change:
In FilterMain.cpp
In applyFilter function
on line 112 we can see:
    "output -> color[plane][row][col] = 0;"
the order for color is plane, row, then col
yet our for loops are originally position so the order is col, row, then plane
swapping plane with col helped increase optimization

Third change:
In FilterMain.cpp
In applyFilter function
on line 114 and 115 we originally see:
    "j < filter -> getSize();" and "i < filter -> getSize();"
instead of calling this function twice
we can make a variable, int filterSize, and set it to filter -> getSize()
then we can place the variable at the top of the function
and replace filter -> getSize() with our variable for lines 114 and 115

Fourth change:
In FilterMain.cpp
In applyFilter function
on line 126 we originally have:
    filter -> getDivisor()
we can make a variable called filterDivisor and set it equal to filter -> getDivisor()
then replace filter -> getDivisor() with the variable on line 126
